## Introduction to Rust

Rust is a high-performance programming language known for its emphasis on safety, concurrency, and performance. Its unique ownership model and borrow checker help prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and data races. Rust is increasingly being adopted for systems programming, web development, game development, and more.

## Official Documentation

* **[The Rust Programming Language (Rust Book)](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>)**: The official and most comprehensive guide to Rust, covering everything from the basics to advanced topics.
* **[Rust by Example](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/>)**: A collection of runnable examples that cover many common programming tasks.
* **[Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](<https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/>)**: This book provides a deep dive into Rust's ownership and borrowing system by implementing linked lists.

## Hands-On Practice

* **[Rustlings](<https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings>)**: A collection of small exercises designed to familiarize you with reading and writing Rust code.
