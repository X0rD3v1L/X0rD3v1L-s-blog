I'm Benarjee Sambangi — known as @X0rD3v1L in some tech communities. I specialize in frontend development, focusing on designing intuitive user interfaces and enhancing user experiences with advanced data visualization techniques.

Recently, I’ve been working on **smart contract development in Rust** at BIMA, contributing to the **Universal Stable on BTC (USBD) project for decentralized finance**. Previously, I've focused on enhancing SaaS solutions by creating and revamping features such as report generation and payroll dashboards. I've developed drag-and-drop form builders and custom template renderers, optimizing core logic and implementing real-time updates for better performance. Early in my career, I gained expertise in **CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS**, developing reusable components and efficient UI designs.

In addition to my professional work, I am continuously expanding my knowledge. I am **learning Zero-Knowledge (zk)** proofs on my own and have a strong background in **Rust and WebAssembly**. I also have knowledge of ethers.js, enhancing my understanding of blockchain technologies and frontend security.

My passion lies in web development, specifically with **React and Rust**, and I enjoy tackling challenges in blockchain and frontend technologies. When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new destinations on a road trip.
